Welcome all of you to MySQL tutorial video series
video 2:

.To create database:
	create database <database_name>;
eg:
	create database transport;

.To see database name in table:
	show databases;

.To use any database:
	use <database_name>
eg:
	use transport;

.To create table inside database:

	create table <table_name>(
	column_name datatype(size),
	column_name2 datatype(size),
	.
	.
	.
	column_name n datatype(size)
	);

eg:
	create table driver(
	name varchar(32),
	age int(32),
	contact int(128),
	bus_number int(32)
	);

.To see about the skeleton of table:
	desc <table_name>;

eg:
	desc driver;


.To insert data in table:
	insert into <table_name> (column_name1,column_name2....column_name n) values (value1,value2,....,value n);

eg:
	insert into driver(name,age,contact,bus_number) values ('hari',32,98651111,234); [we have to enclose varchar attribute into apostrophe]
we can also insert other in same ways

.To see effect in table to know whether table is updated or not:
	
	select * from <table_name>;
* : it ask to display the table with all values included in it

eg:
	select * from driver;

. we can also insert without defining the column_name such as:
	insert into driver values('ram',33,673848,256);
** we must provide the value as table expect to have from us i.e. serially as we have done while defining the table as:name then age then contact and then bus_number

. we can also insert value by shuffling the column name as:
	eg:
		insert into driver (age,name,contact,bus_number) values (45,'rita',4452342,289);



TO UPDATE THE TABLE:
we can update any data of the table by the help of the update command such as:

command:
	update <table_name> set <column_name> = new_value where (primary_attribute> = value;

eg:
	update driver set name = 'ghanshyam' where age  = 45;

we can update any value of the table by the help of the upate command


TO DELETE ANY DATA FROM THE TABLE:

command:
	delete from <table_name> where <primary_key> = value;

eg:
	delete from driver where name = 'ghanshyam';

To delete all the data from the table we use:

command:
	delete from <table_name>;

eg:
	delete from driver;

[This command will delete all the data present in the driver table]


So in this way we can use insert,update and delete command ta manipulate the table so these commands are also known as data manipulation language(DML)

we can also use select command in different ways to display various data in table such as

To display name only:
	select name from driver;
To display name and age:
	select name,age from driver;

In this way we can use select function to display single or multiple datum.

These are the commands and their use which i have teach in this video of MySQL tutorial
