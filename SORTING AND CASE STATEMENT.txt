Sorting and case statement in SQL

sorting:

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

ORDER BY SYNTAX:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC; 

EG:

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY SALARY;

FOR DESCENDING ORDERING:

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY SALARY DESC;

ORDER BY SEVERAL COLUMN:

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY SALARY,COMMISSION;

HERE RESULT TABLE IS SORTED BY USING SALARY AS FIRST PRIORITY BUT COMMISSION CAME UNDER ACTION WHEN WE HAVE GOT SAME SALARY OF MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYEE.


CASE STATEMENT IN SQL:

The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

SYNTAX:

CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END; 

EG:

SELECT ENAME,GENDER ,CASE
	WHEN GENDER = 'F' THEN 'FEMALE'
	WHEN GENDER = 'M' THEN 'MALE'
	ELSE 'NOT VALID'
	END AS RESULT
	FROM EMPLOYEES;

SO IN THIS WAY WE CAN USE ORDER BY COMMAND FOR SORTING AND CASE STATEMENT. DO CHECK MY VIDEOS TAKING THIS THEORY AS REFRENCE WHICH WILL INCREASE YOUR CONCENTRATION OVER THE TOPIC.
