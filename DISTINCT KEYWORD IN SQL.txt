DISTINCT KEYWORD IN SQL

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

HERE I AM NOT PROVIDING ANY NOTES BECAUSE QUERY DONE IN VIDEOS ARE ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN ABOUT DISTINCT KEYWORD.

THANK YOU.
